(a) Line of Credit. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Bank hereby agrees to make advances to Borrower from time to time up
to and including May 1, 1998, not to exceed at any time the aggregate principal
amount of Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00) ("Line of Credit"), the
proceeds of which shall be used for working capital purposes. Borrower's
obligation to repay advances under the Line of Credit shall be evidenced by a
promissory note substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto ("Line of
Credit Note"), all terms of which are incorporated herein by this reference.

(b) Subfeature. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Bank hereby agrees to make advances to Smart(Europe) from time to time up to and
including May 1, 1998, not to exceed at any time the aggregate principal amount
of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) ("Subfeature"), the proceeds of which
shall be used for working capital purposes. Smart(Europe)'s obligation to repay
advances under the Subfeature shall be evidenced by a promissory note

shall be reserved under the Line of Credit and shall not be available for
advances or Letters of Credit thereunder.

(c) Letter of Credit Subfeature. As a subfeature under the Line of
Credit and Subfeature, Bank agrees from time to time during the term thereof to
issue sight commercial and standby letters of credit for the account of Borrower
or Smart(Europe), respectively, to finance working capital and business
requirements (each, a "Letter of Credit" and collectively, "Letters of Credit");
provided however, that the form and substance of each Letter of Credit shall be
subject to approval by Bank, in its sole discretion; and provided further, that
the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit shall not at
any time exceed Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000.00). No Letter of Credit shall
have an expiration date subsequent to the maturity date of the Line of Credit.
The undrawn amount of all Letters of Credit for the account of Borrower shall be
reserved under the Line of Credit and the undrawn amount of all Letters of
Credit for the account of Smart(Europe) shall be reserved under the Subfeature
and shall not be available for borrowings thereunder. Each Letter of Credit
shall be subject to the additional terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit
Agreement and related documents, if any, required by Bank in connection with the
issuance thereof (each, a "Letter of Credit Agreement" and collectively, "Letter
of Credit Agreements"). Each draft paid by Bank under a Letter of Credit shall
be deemed an advance under the Line of Credit or Subfeature, as applicable, and
shall be repaid by Borrower or Smart(Europe), in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement applicable to such advances; provided however, that
if advances under the Line of Credit or Subfacility, as applicable, are not
available, for any reason, at the time any draft is paid by Bank, then Bank
shall so notify Borrower or Smart(Europe), as applicable, and Borrower or
Smart(Europe) shall immediately pay to Bank the full amount of such draft,
together with interest thereon from the date such amount is paid by Bank to the
date such amount is fully repaid by Borrower or Smart(Europe), at the rate of
interest applicable to advances under the Line of Credit. In such event Borrower
agrees that Bank, in its sole discretion, may debit any demand deposit account
maintained by Borrower with Bank for the amount of any such draft.

(d) Borrowing and Repayment. Borrower or Smart(Europe) may from time to
time during the terms of the Line of Credit and Subfeature, respectively borrow,
partially or wholly repay its outstanding borrowings, and reborrow, subject to
all of the limitations, terms and conditions contained herein or in the Line of
Credit Note and Smart(Europe) Note, respectively; provided however, that the
