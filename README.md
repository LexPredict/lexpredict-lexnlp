## Information retrieval and extraction for real, unstructured legal text
LexNLP is a library for working with real, unstructured legal text, including contracts, plans, policies, procedures,

  * Pre-trained segmentation models for legal concepts such as pages or sections.
* Pre-trained word embedding and topic models, broadly and for specific practice areas
* Pre-trained classifiers for document type and clause type
* Broad range of fact extraction, such as:
  * Monetary amounts, non-monetary amounts, percentages, ratios
  * Conditional statements and constraints, like "less than" or "later than"
  * Dates, recurring dates, and durations
  * Courts, regulations, and citations
* Tools for building new clustering and classification methods
* Hundreds of unit tests from real legal documents
