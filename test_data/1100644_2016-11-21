VALIDIAN will not be liable to the LICENSEE for loss of profits, or special, indirect, incidental, consequential or exemplary damages, including costs or legal expenses, in connection with the supply, use of performance of the Software or the performance of its other obligations pursuant to Agreement, even if it is aware of the possibility of the occurrence of such damages.  In certain jurisdictions the foregoing limitations may not be effective, in which case the applicable law will prevail.

7.2

In any event, the total liability of VALIDIAN (including the licensors of products forming part of the Software) to LICENSEE for any claim under this Agreement whether it arises by statute, contract or otherwise, will not exceed the amounts paid to VALIDIAN by LICENSEE under this Agreement for the Software, Support or Services which form the subject of the claim.  The foregoing limit does not apply to the indemnity given in Section 9 or to death or personal injury arising from negligence of VALIDIAN or in respect of accidental loss of, or damage to LICENSEE’s tangible property, to the extent caused by VALIDIAN, its employees or subcontractors.  In the latter event of damage to tangible property, the limit of liability is $1,000,000 (U.S.).

9.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNIFICATION

VALIDIAN will indemnify, defend and hold LICENSEE harmless against any claims, legal actions, losses and other expenses arising out of or in connection with any claims that the Software infringes or violates any intellectual property right of any third party (“Claim”), on the condition that LICENSEE notifies VALIDIAN promptly in writing of the Claim and gives VALIDIAN sole control of the defense and negotiations for its settlement or compromise; provided, however, (i) VALIDIAN shall obtain the prior written consent of LICENSEE (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before entering into any settlement or compromise of such Claim, if the settlement or compromise does not release LICENSEE and its Affiliates from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Claim or the settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable relief against LICENSEE or any of its Affiliates and (ii) LICENSEE shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose.  The fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by LICENSEE.  If LICENSEE is, or may become, prohibited from continued use of any Software by reason of an actual or anticipated Claim, VALIDIAN will use its reasonable efforts to (a) obtain for LICENSEE the right to use the Software, or (b) replace or modify such Software so that it is no longer subject to a Claim, but performs the same functions in an equivalent manner.  If it cannot do so, VALIDIAN will refund to LICENSEE the unused portion of the license fees paid in respect of the Software (determined by depreciating the license fees paid on a straight-line basis over the remainder of any renewal period) and any corresponding unused fees paid in respect of Support.  VALIDIAN will have no liability for any Claim based on (i) use of















other than a prevailing release of the Software (if the Claim could have been avoided by that release and the LICENSEE has been so notified), or (ii) any use or modification of Software not approved by VALIDIAN.  THIS SECTION STATES THE ENTIRE RESPONSIBILITY OF VALIDIAN CONCERNING CLAIMS.

10.

TERM & TERMINATION

10.1

The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall be perpetual unless terminated (i) upon the breach of this Agreement by either party (the “Initial Term”) or (ii) by LICENSEE upon at least 30 days written notice to VALIDIAN.

10.2

The term and rights of termination of this Agreement and of the SSMA for breach shall be subject to and pursuant to Section 7 of the SSMA in Schedule C to this Agreement made a part hereof and incorporated by reference herein.  A party (“Terminating Party”) may, on giving written notice to the other party, terminate any this Agreement or an SSMA on written notice to the other if the other party fails to remedy a breach of any material obligation under this Agreement within thirty (30) days after receiving notice thereof from the Terminating Party.  If this Agreement or an SSMA is terminated, the parties will continue to be liable for any obligations arising, liabilities accrued or amounts payable under this Agreement or that SSMA prior to termination.  In addition to any other remedies, VALIDIAN may seek injunctive relief in respect of any breach of this Agreement by the LICENSEE (or any Affiliate).  Sections 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 12.5 will survive the termination of this Agreement.

11.

Schedule C to the Software License Agreement ("Agreement") By and Between Validian Corporation and Ganthet Mobile Corporation dated November 16, 2016

The Software Support and Maintenance Agreement

Introduction

THIS SOFTWARE SUPPORT and MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT (“SSMA”) is entered into between VALIDIAN Corporation, referred to herein as “VALIDIAN”, and GANTHET MOBILE CORPORATION, the holder of this license, referred to herein as “LICENSEE”.

The terms of this SMA are as follows:

Section 1.  Software Maintenance Services

1.1

VALIDIAN agrees to provide to LICENSEE corrected or modified versions of the Software distributed as either patches to existing releases, or as maintenance releases or new versions of the Software that VALIDIAN makes generally available to end-users and any master keys or root keys necessary to operate and use the Software.

1.2

Such modifications, when delivered and installed, shall become part of the Software and shall otherwise be subject to all of the terms of the License Agreement to which this SSMA is incorporated by reference.

1.3

New versions are major releases of the software in which platform upgrades, substantial additional functionality or improved performance are provided.  Under this maintenance agreement, LICENSEE has the right to receive any new Realm Credentials and to upgrade their license to the new version of the software to replace existing versions as long as LICENSEE is current in payment of any fees under the License Agreement and SSMA have not been terminated.

Section 2.  Error Correction Services

2.1

VALIDIAN shall use reasonable commercial efforts to correct or provide a usable work-around solution for any Critical Error or reproducible material error in the Software, within a reasonable period of time.  VALIDIAN agrees, if feasible, to commence correction within twenty-four (24) hours after such error or malfunction is detected.  If VALIDIAN, in its discretion, requests written verification of an error or malfunction discovered by LICENSEE, LICENSEE shall promptly provide such verification, by email, fax, or overnight mail, setting forth in reasonable detail the respects in which the Software fails to perform.  An error or malfunction shall be “material” if it represents a non-conformity with VALIDIAN's current published specifications for the Software that interferes with the usability of the Software.  VALIDIAN is not obligated to fix errors that are not material.  Upon request, LICENSEE shall provide VALIDIAN remote access to LICENSEE’s computer system for the purpose of remote diagnostics.

2.2

LICENSEE shall pay VALIDIAN at VALIDIAN's then current time and material rates for work of VALIDIAN spent investigating an error or malfunction that VALIDIAN reasonably determines to have been caused by a modification to the Software not made nor authorized by VALIDIAN.















Section 3.  Telephone Support

3.1

VALIDIAN shall make reasonable email and/or telephone support available to LICENSEE's designated individual(s) who have been trained in the use of VALIDIAN software products. Email and telephone support is available between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Eastern Time (ET), Monday to Friday excluding U.S. and Canadian National Holidays, and consists of problem validation and logging, and preliminary diagnosis of the reported problem.  The intent is to identify a remedy or an avoidance procedure directly by email or over the telephone.

Section 4. Request for Modification of the Software Products

4.1

LICENSEE may at any time request that VALIDIAN make additional modifications to the Software Products to add functions or improve performance.  VALIDIAN shall respond to a request for such work with the terms on which it may be willing to undertake such work, but the decision to do so is in the sole discretion of VALIDIAN.

Section 5.  Delivery

5.1

In order to satisfy any delivery obligation, VALIDIAN may, at its option, send, have delivered to, or email to LICENSEE corrected Program(s), patches, modifications, error corrections, fixes, or releases to the Software provided pursuant to this Agreement, together with installation instructions.

Section 6. Intellectual Property

6.1

All modifications to the Software, including all intellectual property rights associated therewith, made or provided by VALIDIAN pursuant to this Agreement, whether alone or with any contribution from LICENSEE or its personnel, shall be owned exclusively by VALIDIAN and its licensors.

Section 7.  Term

7.1

This Agreement and the SSMA shall commence on the Effective Date, as set forth on page 1 of the License Agreement unless sooner terminated in accordance with this Section or the License Agreement.

7.2

VALIDIAN may terminate this Agreement and SSMA by giving written notice of termination to LICENSEE upon the occurrence of any of the following events:

LICENSEE defaults in the performance of any material requirement or obligation created by this Agreement or the License Agreement and such default is not cured within the applicable cure period;

7.3

No termination of this Agreement and SSMA shall release LICENSEE from any obligation to pay VALIDIAN any amount that has accrued or become payable at or prior to the date of termination.

Section 8.   Miscellaneous

8.1

The date on which VALIDIAN's obligations are required to be fulfilled will be extended for a period equal to the time lost by reason of any delay arising directly or indirectly from acts of God, unforeseeable circumstances, or any other cause beyond VALIDIAN's reasonable control.

8.2

A failure by either party to enforce any right under this Agreement shall not at any time constitute a waiver of such right or any other right, and shall not modify the rights or obligations of either party under this Agreement.

8.3

This Agreement shall obligate and benefit the parties, their personal representatives, heirs, successors, and assigns.  VALIDIAN may assign all or any part of this Agreement and SSMA.

8.4

The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement and SSMA shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision, the remaining provisions being deemed to continue in full force and effect.
